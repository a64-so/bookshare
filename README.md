# bookshare
A web platform for sharing books built with php, mysql, javascript, css, html.

Ever wanted to read some book, but never bought it? Or miss your old library where you used to borrow books from?

BookShare is here to help you out.

The idea is that the users from WCE upload the info of the books that they have. Chances are, someone from our college might have a book you'll love and you'll get to know it from this website! So you can contact that person to get the book. And other people will contact you for the books that you've shared on this website.

You share the books on your own responsibility.

The more books you will share, more people will get motivated to share their books, and you'll get more options to read from. 
You can also review or recommend any books on the website.
